# Coding-Challenges
This repo will be full of challenges I've either submitted during the application process or used to study to prepare and sharpen my skills! Feel free to browse using either the table of contents listed below which also give you a small explaination of what each project does, or if you'd like just wonder through either folder until you find something that interests you. Every coding challenge will have both a source code folder and an executable application so that you can test and see the result without needing to download or publish it yourself.


## Table of Contents
* ### NameSearch Challenge: [Application](https://github.com/CurleyT/Coding-Challenges/tree/main/Applications/NameSearch_Application) | [Source](https://github.com/CurleyT/Coding-Challenges/tree/main/Source_Code/NameSearch_SourceCode)
  * This code allows you to parse through a chunk of text and encrypt any instances of items from a designated list by replacing each character in that item with an 'X', making something like "Jacob" become "XXXXX". Code added after submission allows you to extend the characters it will check each text block for after splitting (i.e. periods, commas, etc..)
